The authorities are Priscian\nand Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by\nAristotle. It is the most important of the arts at\nthis period. Aristotle is the authority, in his logica vetus and logica nova. Rhetoric is the study of\nthe theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of\nthe sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather\nthan the ability to use them. The authority is\nCicero, especially his De Inventione.\nArithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is\nBoethius, De arithmetica. Geometry is concerned\nwith study of plane and solid figures, and the\nauthority is Euclid, in his Elementa. It also deals\nwith the study of light, and Euclid\u2019s Optica is\nthe authority here. Astronomy is concerned\nwith predicting the positions of the stars and\nplanets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the\nLibri Almagesti. Music is purely theoretical, the\nstudy of proportions and musical theory, not\nthe ability to sing or play an instrument. The\nauthority is Boethius, in De Musica.\nArtes Liberales also covers the ability to\nread and write.
