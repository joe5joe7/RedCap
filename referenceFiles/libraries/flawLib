If any enchantment keeps you from your\ntrue love\u2019s side, the power of your devotion can\nprobably break it. Your love is higher than mortal magic, and no magic can make you hate your\nlove, or make you truly betray him. Your True\nLove must be a non-player character. To have\nanother player character as your True Love, see\nthe True Love Virtue on page 50.\nThis Story Hook may be renamed \u201cTrue\nFriend\u201d to cover characters with whom you are\nvery closely linked, but not in a romantic way.\nIf the True Love is significantly weaker\nthan the player character, and not able to provide useful assistance in most cases, this is a\nMajor Flaw. If the True Love is competent,\nequal to or better than the player character,\nthen this is only a Minor Flaw. The True Love\nmay need rescuing occasionally, but more often\nhe will involve the player character in his plans.\n"}, "UNPREDICTABLE MAGIC": {"name": "UNPREDICTABLE MAGIC", "value": "Minor", "type": "Hermetic", "description": "You always roll a stress die when using\nmagic, even if completely relaxed.
